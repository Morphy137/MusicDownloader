# M4A_Downloader üéµ

**A modern, open-source tool to download songs, albums, or playlists from Spotify** as high-quality M4A files, obtaining the audio from YouTube and automatically adding full metadata (title, artist, album, cover art, year, etc.). It features both an intuitive graphical interface (GUI) and a powerful command-line interface (CLI). Now with a fully redesigned interface, button icons, and no ffmpeg dependency.

## üöÄ How does it work?

1. Retrieves song, album, or playlist information from Spotify using the official API (you need your own credentials).
2. Searches for the best YouTube match for each track using yt-dlp.
3. Downloads the audio in the best available quality as M4A (no conversion or ffmpeg required).
4. Adds full metadata and cover art from Spotify using mutagen.
5. The process is fully automatic, robust, and logs progress clearly in both CLI and GUI.

- The program does NOT contain any malware, spyware, or trojans. All code is open source and auditable.
- It is recommended to temporarily disable Antivirus if the browser does not allow you to download it.
- You need your own Spotify API credentials (see below). The app will guide you through the setup the first time you run it.
